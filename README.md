# COMP3000-Blood-Donation-System
<b>Blood Donation System</b>

<b>Project Vision</b>

This project is aimed at people looking to donate blood and blood donor centres. The problem is that not enough people donate blood and, particularly for young people, the process for donating blood is not be clear and obvious. Statistics from the NHS show that in 2019/2020, 416,381 people registered as new blood donors. However, there were only 131,825 new blood donations. This shows that while people have an interest in donating blood, they are not getting out and actually donating. This project is a blood donation web application that will allow people to register and book to donate blood. It will also allow blood donation centres to register and receive bookings. The project will focus on incentivising people to donate blood and make the process easier.
